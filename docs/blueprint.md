- Background color: Dark navy (#18202B) to provide a sleek and professional look.
- Primary color: Soft white (#F0F4EF) to ensure readability and clarity.
- Accent color: Light blue (#A7C4E0) to highlight interactive elements and calls to action.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font known for a neutral, objective appearance.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a proportional sans-serif to contrast well with the body font. Space Grotesk also can substitute the role of body font, in components which don't need the volume of a wall of text.
- Use consistent icons from Lucide React throughout the application, emphasizing simplicity and clarity.
- Maintain a two-part layout with a fixed sidebar on the left and a main content area on the right, ensuring a consistent navigation experience.
